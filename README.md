# Pixel Place (Client)

**Pixel Place** is an interactive online platform where users collaborate to create a massive pixel canvas – one pixel at a time. Inspired by projects like [Reddit r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/), [w/place](https://wplace.live/), and other collective art experiments, it turns chaos and creativity into a living digital mosaic.

## Concept

**Pixel Place isn’t just a project – it’s a social experiment.** It’s about coexistence on a single canvas, where hundreds of users shape a shared digital world – sometimes chaotic, sometimes beautiful, always alive.

It’s pixel democracy: **each user gets one pixel, but together, they build art.**

## About the Project

This is the author’s second full-fledged project, and the MVP was built in just 10 days. The project allowed the author to practice WebSockets, real-time collaboration, and state synchronization. Ever since starting programming, the author dreamed of creating a project like this – a digital canvas shaped by lot of users simultaneously.
